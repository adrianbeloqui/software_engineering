    "R-2.15 The Vector class of Section 2.3.3 provides a constructor that takes an integer d, and produces a d-dimensional vector with all coordinates equal to 0. Another convenient form for creating a new vector would be to send the constructor a parameter that is some iterable type representing a sequence of numbers, and to create a vector with dimension equal to the length of that sequence and coordinates equal to the sequence values. For example, Vector([4, 7, 5]) would produce a three-dimensional vector with coordinates <4, 7, 5>. Modify the constructor so that either of these forms is acceptable; that is, if a single integer is sent, it produces a vector of that dimension with all zeros, but if a sequence of numbers is provided, it produces a vector with coordinates based on that sequence."

The class also receives implicit support of the Boolean test, “k in r” for Range r. This test is evaluated based on a forward iteration through the range, as evidenced by the relative quickness of the test 2 in Range(10000000) versus 9999999 in Range(10000000). Provide a more efficient implementation of the `__contains__` method to determine whether a particular value lies within a given range.

    "P-2.39 Develop an inheritance hierarchy based upon a Polygon class that has abstract methods area( ) and perimeter( ). Implement classes Triangle, Quadrilateral, Pentagon, Hexagon, and Octagon that extend this base class, with the obvious meanings for the area( ) and perimeter( ) methods. Also implement classes, IsoscelesTriangle, EquilateralTriangle, Rectangle, and Square, that have the appropriate inheritance relationships. Finally, write a simple program that allows users to create polygons of the various types and input their geometric dimensions, and the program then outputs their area and perimeter. For extra effort, allow users to input polygons by specifying their vertex coordinates and be able to test if two such polygons are similar."
